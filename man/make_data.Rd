\title{Make regression dataframe from quadrature}
\usage{
make_data(Q, potentials, focal_cell = NULL, covariates = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Q}{Logistic regression quadrature scheme, as generated by make_quadrature}

\item{potentials}{Named list of potential functions, each taking a distance as input}

\item{focal_cell}{Focal cell type (character) for which the regression is computed}

\item{covariates}{Optional matrix of spatial covariates with one row per quadrature point
(both data and dummy points for the focal cell). Columns represent different covariates.
If provided, these will be appended to the design matrix after dispersion features.}

\item{verbose}{Logical flag for verbosity (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
A list containing the design matrix (`data`) with an intercept, dispersion features,
        and optional covariates; and the response vector (`response`) indicating data (1) vs. dummy (0) points.
}
