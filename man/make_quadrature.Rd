\title{Construct a quadrature scheme for spatial logistic regression}
\usage{
make_quadrature(
  pp,
  scale_factor = NULL,
  n_dummy = NULL,
  min_dummy = 100,
  dist = "random"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pp}{A \code{ppp} object (spatstat point pattern). Must be a multitype pattern (i.e., have factor-valued marks).}

\item{scale_factor}{Optional numeric value specifying the multiplier applied to the number of observed points 
for determining the number of dummy points per cell type. Must not be used with \code{n_dummy}.}

\item{n_dummy}{Optional integer specifying a fixed number of dummy points per cell type. Overrides \code{scale_factor}.}

\item{min_dummy}{Minimum number of dummy points per type (used only when \code{scale_factor} is set and observed count is low). Default is 100.}

\item{dist}{Character string indicating how to generate dummy points. Options are \code{"random"} (default) for homogeneous Poisson process, 
or \code{"grid"} for grid-based dummy points.}
}
\value{
A \code{quadscheme} object (class "quad") from \pkg{spatstat.geom}, with appropriately marked data and dummy points.
}
\description{
Generates a quadrature scheme from a multitype spatial point pattern by adding 
dummy points of each type and pairing them with observed data points. This is 
used in approximating the conditional intensity via logistic regression in spatial models.
}
\details{
The number of dummy points per cell type can be controlled either by a fixed value 
(`n_dummy`) or as a multiple of the observed count via a scaling factor (`scale_factor`).
Only one of `n_dummy` or `scale_factor` should be supplied.
